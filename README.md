# 💻 Computer Rental Management System (Secure System Design & Analysis)

A secure, web-based **Computer Rental Management System** designed to automate rental operations, inventory management, and customer handling. This project focuses on **system design, implementation, and security controls**, incorporating **threat modeling and risk mitigation using the STRIDE framework** 🔐.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Automated computer rental and return management  
- 🗂 Centralized inventory and supplier management  
- 👥 Admin and customer role separation  
- 🔐 Secure authentication with CAPTCHA and OTP  
- 🔑 Password hashing and secure session management  
- 🛡 STRIDE-based threat modeling and mitigation  
- 📊 Detailed admin dashboard and customer portal  

## 🏢 Project Background

The Computer Rental Management System was developed for **Sinaro**, an organization that previously relied on **manual, paper-based processes** for computer rentals, inventory tracking, and maintenance scheduling. These manual processes resulted in **operational inefficiencies, data inconsistency, and poor user experience**.

This project proposes a **secure and automated system** to enhance operational efficiency, reduce errors, and improve data security. It was developed as part of an **Information Security Project**, emphasizing **secure system implementation and risk management**.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

- ❌ Manual booking and inventory tracking caused delays and frequent errors  
- ❌ Lack of centralized system led to ineffective inventory and maintenance management  
- ❌ Poor user experience for both customers and staff  
- ❌ Increased security risks due to absence of structured security controls  

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Design an automated computer rental system to replace manual processes  
- ✅ Improve inventory and rental management efficiency  
- ✅ Enhance system security using encryption and authentication mechanisms  
- ✅ Apply threat modeling to identify and mitigate security risks  
- ✅ Develop and test a secure system prototype
